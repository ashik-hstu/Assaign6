          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const .
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but
          they have different scopes and behaviors. Understanding their scope is
          crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. Here's a discussion
          of the scope of each: <br /><br />
          <span class="text-2xl text-black font-medium"> var:</span>
          <span class="underline"> Function Scope:</span> Variables declared
          with var are function-scoped, which means they are accessible
          throughout the entire function in which they are declared. <br />
          <span class="underline"> Hoisting:</span>
          var variables are hoisted to the top of their containing function or
          global scope. This means that the variable declarations are processed
          before the code is executed, but the assignments remain where they are
          in the code. <br />
          <span class="underline"> Re-declaration:</span>
          Variables declared with var can be re-declared within the same scope
          without any error.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="text-2xl text-black font-medium"> let:</span>
          <span class="underline"> Block Scope:</span>
          Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are
          accessible only within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which
          they are defined. Hoisting: let variables are hoisted, but unlike var,
          they are not initialized. This means you cannot access the variable
          before its declaration in the code. <br />
          <span class="underline"> No Re-declaration:</span>
          You cannot re-declare a variable with the same name in the same scope
          using let. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="text-2xl text-black font-medium"> const:</span>
          <span class="underline"> Block Scope:</span>
          Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped. <br />
          <span class="underline"> Hoisting:</span>
          const variables are hoisted, but like let, they are not initialized.
          Immutable Value: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned
          after they are initialized. However, the value they reference (in case
          of objects and arrays) can still be modified.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined .
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, null and undefined are both used to represent the
          absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts
          and have different use cases: <br /><br />
          <span class="text-2xl text-black font-medium">undefined:</span>
          <span class="underline"> Default Value:</span>
          When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is
          automatically initialized to undefined. <br />
          <span class="underline"> Function Return:</span>

          When a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
          undefined. <br />
          <span class="underline"> Missing Object Properties:</span>

          When you try to access an object property that does not exist, the
          result is undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          <span class="text-2xl text-black font-medium">null:</span>
          <span class="underline"> Intentional Absence:</span>

          null is often used when you want to explicitly indicate that a
          variable should have no value or that an object property intentionally
          has no value. <br />
          <span class="underline">Clearing Values:</span>

          You can assign null to a variable or object property to indicate that
          it should no longer hold a value.

        <p class="text-red-600 text-3xl my-6">What do you mean by REST API?</p>
        <p>
          REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application
          Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and
          constraints for designing and interacting with web services. REST is
          not a specific technology or protocol; rather, it is an architectural
          style that uses the HTTP protocol for communication.<br /><br /> Key principles
          and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:<br /><br /> Statelessness: Each
          request from a client to a server must contain all the information
          needed to understand and process the request. The server should not
          rely on any information from previous requests. This makes REST APIs
          scalable and easy to cache.<br /><br /> Client-Server Architecture: REST separates
          the client and server responsibilities, allowing them to evolve
          independently. Clients and servers can be developed and maintained
          separately, as long as they adhere to the same API contract.<br /><br />
          Resource-Based: Resources are the fundamental concept in REST.
          Everything is treated as a resource, and each resource is identified
          by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Resources can represent
          objects, data, or services. HTTP Methods: REST uses standard HTTP
          methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on
          resources. These methods have well-defined meanings, making the API
          predictable and easy to understand.
          <br /><br />
          GET: Retrieve data from the server.
          <br />
          POST: Create a new resource on the server.
          <br />
          PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
          <br />
          DELETE: Remove a resource from the server. And others like PATCH,
          HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.
          <br /><br />
          Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface,
          which simplifies client-server interactions. This includes the use of
          standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found)
          and the consistent use of URLs.
          <br /><br />
          Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as
          JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients can specify the desired
          representation using HTTP headers (e.g., Accept header).
          <br /><br />
          Stateless Communication: RESTful interactions between clients and
          servers are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a
          server must contain all the information needed to understand and
          process the request. Any required session state should be stored on
          the client side. RESTful APIs are widely used for building web
          services due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of
          integration. They are commonly used for data retrieval, CRUD (Create,
          Read, Update, Delete) operations, and more. Popular web services like
          Twitter, Facebook, and many others provide RESTful APIs for developers
          to access their data and services.
